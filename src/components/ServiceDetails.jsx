        As a Sr. Product Designer, you’ll join a group of multi-disciplinary
        designers who care deeply about helping people learn from their data.
        Our process starts with defining a vision in collaboration with product
        and engineering. Then we research, refine and remove (less is more)
        until we've landed on something that truly helps our customers. This
        role will have a strategic focus; however, you'll get broad exposure to
        the product and pair with other team leads to design a cohesive
        experience.

        As a Sr. Product Designer, you’ll join a group of multi-disciplinary
        designers who care deeply about helping people learn from their data.
        Our process starts with defining a vision in collaboration with product
        and engineering. Then we research, refine and remove (less is more)
        until we've landed on something that truly helps our customers. This
        role will have a strategic focus; however, you'll get broad exposure to
        the product and pair with other team leads to design a cohesive
        experience.
